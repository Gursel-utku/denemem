# Applied Data Science Capstone
# Peer-graded Assignment: Capstone Project - The Battle of Neighborhoods

Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve.

# 1) Introduction/Business Problem
The aim of this study is to help people planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto to choose the right location by giving data on competitors that are already present in the same areas as the income and population of each neighborhood.
# 2) Downloading and Prepping Data
To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Toronot's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.
Toronto's Census data is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a
Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f
# 3) Methodology
For this report, I used several different maps that could help a new investor decide on the best neighborhood to open a restaurant in Toronto based on income, population, and current competitors. To do this, I combined the 2016 Census information with coroplet maps to visually view richer and more populated neighborhoods, and used Foursquare data to view available restaurants in each area.
# 4) Results
When we compare the maps, we can see most of the restaurants on the main streets and grouped with changing, when the busiest neighborhoods can be in the north. It also expands densely populated areas.
# 5) Discussion
When I decided to create this work, I was expecting to find clusters of restaurants in certain areas, but the result I got didn't meet that expectation.
# 6) Conclusion
This report may be useful for someone planning to open a restaurant in Toronto by comparing current offerings and neighborhood profiles, but may not cover all variables such as access to public transport or even restaurant options, more information is needed to get precise information on this issue.
